her at five peacefully hans herman has exchanged a lot since last summer so the first ever fully phone from one plus came out this week is called a one plus one thing one has a good man but the ferry very faring good for fun homeland is that for about three weeks after i left him thing to say about what actually happened it's so good as actually reserve is the old question in my head from probably years ago which is once again take for regular people to actually start buying foreign funds because yet i like the sound and domingo and guess that some other viewers will like this don't you and seventies useful like this on and this video may even get a lot of used but none of that necessarily translates into regular people just like strolling into a store work on online in choosing to buy one of these seltzer since first the details of this thought so this is a super high and found in every way in the design is particularly well considered you see it's basically the same size as a normal phone on the outside is a six point three inch twenty by nine cover display just over ten eight he felt yukio down to ten hurts it's an absurdly break two thousand eight hundred minutes max brightness between these pretend as service actually does take the crown now for the bride is display i have ever seen in its martha family go ahead and give it the co crown for best culpable to use wall close alongside it takes a fault so i still think that it's a full has this more rich boy has there been placements it's a bit shorter but there's no question this feels like a fight chiffon on the outside even if you never even opened a thing there's also a bunch of design touches i really like the flat size other way around super cleaned the alert slider is also back so it's way up there at the top of the fonz caught up to reach but i'll other words exactly as you'd expect same as previous want the phones at and the power but most of the lives of fame career which we've seen with five cities folds is what sauce on and around the back may stand out say i'm not the biggest fake leather on the back the phone person it does me like samson twenty sixteen sides bomb the lisa does my fingerprints does the other calling out it's it's a green it looks neat and clean air but really the future is a gigantic him about that yesterday crazy looking bright but they also happens to be exactly where right index finger rests on the back of the fall so sudden nice little shelf that feels really natural when you sing a song walk closed so i cannot really liked it so that also the elie de flash it's a good fit so they set up in the corner for some reason why they knew open this thing up and it just to become so obvious why they waited so long to do their first full doubled it looks nothing like some of the other first janet folding screen some years ago that this huge seven point eight inch quarter corner multi peel three point oh display that again goes up to two thousand eight hundred nuts and down to one hurts even bells all where round couple kleinschmidt top corner and honestly one of the least visible creases you'll see a full length on twenty twenty three now i think it's actually to be able to get technically called this their first full mobile phone because wall one plus hasn't made a fool boy yet there sister company abo clearly has so any surprises this to go out attack from them actually there is another gesture we stop a phone call the oppel find and three is to say mrs that whistle stands with the screen on you clearly don't see the trees at all can screen off you still gonna have to look for him and yet you hit the angle where the light reflects off an old song and then you can see it but this one those phones that looks really good for almost every angle you actually use it an assassin of those changes that stays at whenever angle that you hold that so if you want to serve and i need your yang lower little more open or closed he can do that and as a nice satisfying spring loaded clap shot is also it's impressively famous father this one are seen by predates lighter than you'd expect to actually be put on a scale of pastry meat zack same weight as an iphone fourteen pro hundred u. n. stainless steel so just the regular phone weeds is impressive these hard work of them saw for fitness wanna use one plus so it's it's oxygen allies thirteen that you have got all kinds of look two weeks in little features that power uses an los because let's face it is a phone for carries us people were in all of that continually features between the open screen in the clothes screen so what sir john using in begat used clothes it like this and in spite of to pick up we left off on the outside spring if you want to try to fight the peso fold it's been a mere ear home screen set out automatically between the cover screen and the inside screens of you if you change something like move a folder with sugar and out on won and switch to the other you will have also moved from there to keep some womb or enhanced our set the option to change that censuses andrei and anna power user but nevertheless that's the way it is to them is also it hon of multitasking features on the inside screened for having multiple that's open wants so you can have an easy one out open full screen that looks good for surprise number battle stretch them if they're not beautifully built this but then you can have to ask side by side and then you can take a third act again next general disarray next to each other in this triple panel view you can move things between the quickly porky pig shallow four fingers you can see all of all of the acts that wants to between that and the dock with all the rats in recent files this is a very well considered called for sitting down and just getting stuffed up my guess like let's sit down and openness on about to be really productive and a lot on this on the one plus open honestly it nailed as a phony nails all five of my colors of green scarf on pre screen great battery great old great performance great camera aladdin generous with that stuff that might actually nails all that stuff the jury heard about the great screen benefactor the match each other so well inside and outside is there a pre great there's also great performance super high and specks that thirty began to sixteen gates of fast ram five hundred twelve teams of u. s. s. four point oh storage them in paris hundred twenty hertz i'll keep you displays have a two hundred forty urged to sample rate in super responsive and valuable thing feels very future proof annie also heard about the bill quality which will revisit then the second but then battery life has also been excellent with this forty eight hundred million car battery and it's sixty seven walk fast charging although it's just skip suarez charging for some reason which is like the most wondrous thing ever buy i think it had slight no cost in no way to new fitness for yet they leave it out while the other competitors have it anyway are i find that in this huge camelot on the back kind implies high and cameras be can ever really be sure into a custom and sure enough this house a live camera senate is pretty decent status news that sensor for the primaries answer affiliates telephoto an old why i found it's it's pretty good most the time i was not very good fleecing motion which is fine if you take photos of still subjects but the second it's people or animals and those things start to move out bennett to become hard getting a shutter speeds that's not to freeze that stuff you basically have to switch to action mode which the button for and that works by franken assures the way out as expected but then i am so thirsty get blow high high enough that photos are now illinois year ago worse looking so just as unfortunate and i like this is one of five pillars but also found that the microphone on the song is actually quite good reason not as good as business prize but often together in are really nice song that i think a lot of people to myself for her really liked using so the question is why why think people find buying folding phones out much if there is good turns out the phone get it all five pillars of greece my phone and not be a great bye for everyone necessarily so really comes out of three things i think number one is still price number two is it your building question in number three is just the power user problems on price this song is one thousand seven hundred dollars us that is a lot of money to spend a lot of thought no matter how you trot out in the monthly segment sir staggered payment says the la riots wearily twice as much as five and fifteen but guess what that's literally right in line with its folding competitors like give it to fully fund the ws days of old eating hundred dollars samsung's evil five eighteen hundred dollars so this has actually come aboard and that's the most obvious thing holding these back his wrist so expensive but then number two durability is also it's questionable at best now of course they do all the testing that they can and guess what they've got like decks for water resistance which is nice and have the durability reading for a million folds of the hinge that's great but then what are these dead pixels asserted peering at the bottom middle of my screen right around the hinge i was on for three weeks and baby it and this is our race tarnish open mind doesn't use any bad for everyone but that's not great and i suspect it's not gonna happen on non falling bombs but the third and final reason fooling songs as great as they've been getting aren't necessarily translate into mainstream success is that their power reserve funds they're pulling in avoiding is a power reserves teacher and carries her features much the 'em don't sell conference we figured this out many times when elegy spain using years making some of the most manually just go cameras in the scarf on world and adam is part of any more we saw at salim who can stop making professional cameras in his car phone by me but their sales are putting them in danger the same thing and the season phones are absolutely incredible right now for a disease like myself but they've already fled had fake clue they're not doing super well either as they be willing to bet without even being elected anyone's books that the foley phones are not at the top of sales in any of the lineups maybe companies were making these things probably the most compelling folding phone hard work i've seen yet is this on her phone this thing's called upon are magic v. to bruck listen this is it's super thin it has all the ratings all right places guthrie be printed titanium hinge coverage barely showing any trace wanted to open finn vessels nice screens all way around somehow as of five thousand million dark battery inside and high and specs like playing with this on over almost anything else over even samsung's has helped me appreciate what folding phone hard work can actually be but despite all that austin is it still has those kind of obvious downsides for regular person to probably not take it or regular from the price tag for two hundred bucks the durability potentially comprise we are now and then even though it is thin awesome is still is like the the power user thing of wanting to carry slowly thicker phone around and have that extra ability it's not something everyone sees is obvious and something actually want we're senate finally see some of those flipping phones comden these closer to the mainstream because they are lower in price the disease of five is that a thousand bucks from samsung and more religious launch their most affordable float yet the reserve for ye think is launching soon at six hundred bucks so that seems to be getting closer but it's just leave a lot more of that stuff so performing songs are simultaneously burial vaults from their beginning has just a few years ago and yet still out who belong to one yes i have to get there who are compressed nerves f. what's right and who isn't it obvious ha ha ha
